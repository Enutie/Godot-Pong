# Godot-Pong

## 20 Game Challenge: Number 1 - Make Pong!

### Step 1: Make a game!
Gain a basic understanding of your game engine/editor and put together a complete (but small) game!

Don't worry about making art just yet, you can find a lot of sprites online that you can use. The main focus for now is on the mechanics of the game engine itself.

### Things that you will learn:
- Using your game engine of choice!
- Creating and destroying objects.
- Processing player input and moving objects on screen.
- Detecting and reacting to collisions.

### A Bit of History
Pong was the first widely successful arcade game. It was released in 1972, and started the first arcade boom. The game may seem simple today, but it was designed directly in hardware. Essentially, Pong was a specialized computer designed to bounce a ball between two paddles and keep score.

You don't have to make this from computer parts, of course! With a modern engine, this should be a fairly simple start.

- Complexity: ðŸŒŸ
- Scope: ðŸŒŸ

### Goals:
1. Create an arena with two walls and a divider.
2. Add a paddle on either end of the play field. Use player inputs to move the paddles up and down.
3. Add a ball that moves around the playfield and bounces off of the paddles and walls.
4. Detect when the ball leaves the playfield. Assign a point to the player who scored.
5. Track and display the score for each player.

### Stretch goals:
1. Write an AI script that can follow the ball so you can play with only one player.
   - Hint: Following the ball with a paddle is easy, but it makes the opponent impossible to beat. You might want to make the AI less than perfect somehow.
2. Add a menu and allow the player to reset the game.
3. Add some basic sounds. Play a sound every time the ball collides with something, and every time a player scores.
